This package adds line breaking functionality for python and julia.

This has not been tested on other languages but should theoretically work with
similar arg separation and function call/brace syntax. You can also modify the
=break-line-opening-delim-regex= and =break-line-arg-sep-regex= vars as you
wish to encompass more styles.

The package currently breaks the line via one of three styles defined in
=break-line-functions=. To modify the call order or default line breaker, just
modify that list. You can also add your own line styles to the list should you
see fit.

The line should break as long as your cursor is positioned on the line and the
line you wish to break has been folden to reside on only a single line.

See https://github.com/IvanMalison/multi-line for another more mature
line-breaking package, but it did not work the way I wanted for the languages I
primarily work with.
