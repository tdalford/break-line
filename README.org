This package adds line breaking functionality for python and julia.

This has not been tested on other languages but should theoretically work with
similar arg separation and function call/brace syntax. You can also modify the
=break-line-opening-delim=regex= and =break-line-arg-sep=regex= vars as you
wish to encompass more styles.

See https://github.com/IvanMalison/multi-line for another more mature
line-breaking package, but it did not work quite the way I wanted for the
languages I primarily work with.
